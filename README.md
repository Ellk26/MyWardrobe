# MyWardrobe
This app allows you to store photos of your clothes in an collection view feed so you can easily figure out what you have in your closet. It also tells you basic weather conditions and offers suggestions of what to wear based on the items you've collected.

In order to make it work for you change the API key in Constants.swift to your own API key from open weather API. Also change the API call in WeatherModel.swift from "MyConstants" to "Constants"
